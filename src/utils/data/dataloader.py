    """Unpickle the CIFAR-10 dataset.

    Args:
        path (str, optional): Path of the CIFAR-10 directory. Defaults to "datasets/cifar10/cifar-10-batches-py".
        pickle_file (str, optional): The pickle file to be handled, the default value "all" will handle all pickle files. Defaults to "all".

    Returns:
        unpickle_dicts: If pickle_file is set to "all", a list of dictionaries will be returned. Otherwise, only a dictionary will be returned.
        Keys and values in each unpickle_dict:
        - b'batch_label': the name of the batch, e.g. b'training batch 1 of 5'.
        - b'labels': the labels of the batch data, e.g. 0, 2, 1, etc..
        - b'data': a numpy.ndarray object (shape (10000, 3072)) containing the batch data.
            Each row respresents a RGB image, the first 1024 enrtries for Red color, the next two 1024 entries are for Green and Blue. 
        - b'filenames': the file names of the batch data, e.g. b'tabby_s_002228.png'.
